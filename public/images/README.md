# OJ CMS demo photography

The Gorynych public site's custom assets are documented separately in [`docs/ASSETS.md`](../../docs/ASSETS.md). The four alpine images below belong to the preserved OJ CMS demo interface.

These four original demonstration images were generated with the built-in imagegen tool for OJ CMS on 2026-09-22, using the user-supplied dashboard mockup as an art-direction reference. They are photorealistic illustrations of fictional architecture and landscapes, not photographs of a named property.

Files are locally bundled WebP, 1536 × 1024, quality 84. There are no third-party image URLs or runtime image downloads. The source PNGs remain in the generation archive; these optimized files are the distributable project assets.

## Prompt briefs

- `concrete-villa.webp`: editorial photograph of a pale board-formed concrete villa, black framed glass, pine trees and distant alpine mountains; low oblique view, building on the right, soft pale sky on the left. Match the mockup's shallow hero image. No people, text or logo.
- `alpine-house.webp`: low contemporary alpine cabin with warm interior light, concrete roof and full-height glass; a stone path, pine tree and dramatic dark mountains at overcast twilight. Match the mockup's site-preview photograph. No UI, text or watermark.
- `alpine-mist.webp`: layered rugged alpine peaks and pines in white mist; desaturated charcoal rock, fine photographic detail and airy fog at the top. Match the mockup's sidebar mountain motif. No buildings, people or text.
- `alpine-interior.webp`: contemporary alpine villa living room, natural stone and concrete, walnut furniture, cream sofa and full-height mountain-view windows; warm afternoon light and restrained architectural editorial composition. No people, text or logo.

The OJ logo is separately implemented as deterministic SVG letterforms in `src/components/brand/oj-logo.tsx`; it is not a raster image.
